# CCST ForensiCTF

Tools and Challenge files can be found in the .zip file. They had to be split into 24 MB files (you can unzip them with any zipping tool, for example with 7zip).
Additionally, you can use the presentation slides while solving the challenges, as it includes recommended resources to  solve them.

Make sure to run the tools as Administrator!

Tools are mainly from:
* https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md
* https://www.nirsoft.net/

For Eric Zimmerman Tools, .net 6 software requires at least Microsoft .net 6 or newer! You will get errors running these without at least .net 6. When in doubt, install it! NOTE: Make sure you get the Desktop runtime if you plan on running any of the GUI programs

Can be installed from here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0
